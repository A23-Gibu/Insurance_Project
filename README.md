# Insurance_Project

In this project, I will conduct an analysis of medical insurance data from the United States utilizing the Python programming language, utilizing only the 'csv' library. The data will be imported as a 'csv' file and subsequently separated into individual columns, creating lists for each for ease of use. 
Subsequently, 7 distinct functions will be developed to calculate various metrics of the data. 
Finally, a dictionary containing the lists will be created for potential future analysis.
Suggestions are always welcome!
